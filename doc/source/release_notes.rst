release notes
===================

This demo package does not have release notes here, see point 1.

When release notes are maintained manually:

1. sometimes it is part of the formatted documentation (like this document).
   Advantage: it is easier to access and read than repo md documentations.
   On `<http://pypi.org>`_, links to git repo and documentation are both possible.
   Check out this package at the `test.pypi.org repo <https://test.pypi.org/project/pip-package-demo>`_!
#. sometimes it is included in markdown files in the repository.
   Advantage: no need to compile into the formatted docs.

What are release notes?
------------------------
Release notes show what new features each of the program version has compared
to the older version.

While the git repository shows the difference between any commits, it may
provide a too much details and one may be interested in the larger picture.
This can be also achieved with git: keeping the history of the
master branch clean, and changing version number when a feature's merge request
(aka pull request) is completed, and add the release notes to the commit's
comment. However, completely manual ways also exist. The drawback is that
one needs to maintain it manually.
